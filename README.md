# Movie Management API

This project is a backend API for managing a collection of movies. It is built with NestJS, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM. The API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, and rating movies.

## Features

- Add and retrieve movies with detailed information such as title, release date, description, and genre.
- Rate movies on a scale to gauge their popularity and quality.

## Tech Stack

- NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the development experience.
- Prisma ORM: A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- Swagger: A tool to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources.

## Setup

1. Clone the Repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-management-api.git
  cd movie-management-api
  ```

2. Install Dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

3. Environment Variables:
  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/moviedb?schema=public" 
  ```

## Database Setup

1. Prisma Initialization:
  Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running. Then, initialize the Prisma schema.
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  npx prisma generate
  ```

2. PgAdmin Setup:
  Use pgAdmin to manage your PostgreSQL database. You can execute SQL scripts in pgAdmin to create and manage your tables if needed.

3. Sample Data:
  Here is some sample data to get started:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO "Movie" (title, "releaseDate", description, genre, rating) VALUES
  ('The Shawshank Redemption', '1994-09-23', 'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.', 'Drama', 9.3),
  ('The Godfather', '1972-03-24', 'The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.', 'Crime', 9.2),
  ('The Dark Knight', '2008-07-18', 'When the menace known as the Joker emerges from his mysterious past, he wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham.', 'Action', 9.0);
  ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Application:
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

2. Swagger UI:
